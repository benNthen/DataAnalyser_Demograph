Unit tests are written for the user under `test_module.py`.

### Development

For development,  `main.py` is used to test the functions. Click the "run" button and `main.py` will run.

### Testing 

The tests were imported from `test_module.py` to `main.py` for the user's convenience. The tests will run automatically whenever you hit the "run" button.
